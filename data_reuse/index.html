      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        Data reuse saves time and accelerates the pace of scientific discovery. By making your
        data open and available to others, you make it possible for future researchers to answer
        questions that haven’t yet been asked. Thinking about data reuse in advance and documenting
        it, saves you time by helping you plan research processes and workflow early in the
        research project. Finally, this documentation makes it easier for you to defend your
        research... remember back to second grade when your teacher told you to “show your work”.
      </p>

      <p>
        When it comes to making your work reusable, “the devil is in the details”. Upon completion
        of this exercise, you will have a detailed data reuse plan which you can save as a README
        or text file to store with your data files so others can understand and reuse your data.
        Extra bonus feature: it provides an outline for the “Methodology” section of any publications
        that arise from this data.
      </p>

      <h2 id="steps-to-complete">Steps to Complete</h2>

      <ol class="steps">
        <!-- Step 1 -->
        <li>
          <h1>Identify Roles</h1>
          <time>5 minutes</time>
          <p>
            Break into groups of 2-5 people.  Identify one volunteer to be the "Researcher"
            and describe their research data set for this exercise.  This person will need
            to be fairly familiar with how and why the data was collected.
          </p>

          <p>
            Identify a note taker to record responses to questions from the group about the
            data set.
          </p>
        </li>

        <!-- Step 2 -->
        <li>
          <h1>Interview</h1>
          <time>30-40 minutes</time>
          <p>
            Using the <a href="https://github.com/mozillascience/working-open-workshop/blob/gh-pages/handouts/data_reuse_plan_template.md">
            Data Reuse Plan Template</a> as a guide, members of the group ask questions
            of the "Researcher" about her or his data set while the note taker records responses.
            The note taker can (and is encouraged) to ask questions too.  As you ask questions,
            think about how you would (or if you could) respond to a similar question about your
            data set.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have time, upon completion of the worksheet, review your responses and make
            sure they would be clear to someone viewing your data set for the first time.  You are
            writing this for someone you have never met.  Avoid jargon and abbreviations where
            possible.
          </p>
        </li>

        <!-- Step 3 -->
        <li>
          <h1>Review &amp; Discuss</h1>
          <time>10-15 minutes</time>
          <p>
            Review the following questions and be prepared to share out your responses with
            the larger group.
            <ol>
              <li>
                Which parts of the template were particularly challenging? Why? What research
                best practices could you put into place to make it easier?
              </li>
              <li>
                If you weren't able to provide some of the information in the worksheet, is
                there a way you can get it?  If not, is there something you could have done
                differently during your research project to collect that information?
              </li>
              <li>
                Are there pieces of information missing from this worksheet that would help
                someone understand your data and make it easier to reuse?
              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>
        </li>

        <!-- Step 4 -->
      </ol>

          <h3>Open Data</h3>
          <p>
            Data that is made easily and freely available for anyone to access, use, and
            share without restrictions, the possible exception being a requirement of
            attribution.

        <section class="term">
          <h3>Metadata</h3>
          <p>
            Information that describes, explains, locates, or in some way makes it easier to
            find, access, and use a resource (in this case, data). For example, metadata for
            a photograph may include the name of the photographer, when and where it was taken,
            as well as the type of camera and settings used to take the photograph.

        <section class="term">
          <h3>Licensing</h3>
          <p>
            A license gives explicit permissions for the use of something. This is particularly
            important if you want to make your data open as some jurisdictions assign
            copyrights to data sets which limit their use. There are several types of
            licenses that are in common use for data. You can read more about them
            here: <a href="http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/how-guides/license-research-data">
            http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/how-guides/license-research-data</a>.

        <section class="term">
          <h3>Naming Conventions</h3>
          <p>
            These are a set of predefined rules for the naming and structure of folders, files,
            field names, etc. (E.g. All files begin with a date, location and project name.)
            Naming conventions help provide context to a data set, as well as make sure a
            standard of data collection and management is being followed by all members of a
            team.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="term">
          <h3>Permanent Identifiers</h3>
          <p>
            A permanent identifier (or PID) is a set of numbers and/or characters, frequently
            in the form of a URL, that points to the location of a resource. PIDs are set up
            in such a way that even though the storage location of the resource may change
            over time (e.g. moving data from one university server to another), the PID will
            always point to the correct location. DOI is a commonly known type of PID.

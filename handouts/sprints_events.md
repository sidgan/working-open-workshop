### Intro to material:

Well organized, welcoming and inclusive sprints & events take some time to prepare.  

### Steps to complete:
Consider the following questions in each section and answer them as detailed as possible. We,ve provided tips to help you better plan, and suggestions of the kind of materials and needs you might consider.

1. **Pre-sprint planning**:

* **General Information**:

* What is the overall goal /purpose of your event ?

* Who is your (target audience) ?

* What is the format for the event ?

* Is there a budget for the event ?

* When will the event take place ?

**Tip**:  In picking a date remember to consider any special events / religious holidays / family time / seasonal workloads.


**Venue and Room Set-up**:

 * Where will it be held ?

 * Take a moment to think about three possible places for your event

 * How many will it need to hold ?

 * How will the room be arranged?

 * Are there lots of electrical plug-ins ?


 * **Tip**: When considering a venue make sure to pick one that is accessible, close to public transit and has parking options for those coming from a distance.


    * **Tip**: The room should be large enough to hold all attendees at round tables. For example, for a group of 60 attendees there should be room for 8-10 tables, if the tables seat 6-8 attendees. There should be space at the front of the room for a podium, a flip chart, and projection screen that is visible to all attendees.


    **Food and Beverage**:

    * Is there budget for the food and drink ?

    * What food will you provide ?


    * **Tip**:  Food and beverage service is not required, but is typically appreciated by attendees. For full-day workshops, it is recommended that light breakfast items along with coffee and tea be provided in the morning, lunch at midday, and a light snack during an afternoon break. It is useful to have coffee and water provided throughout the day, if possible.


    * **Tip**: If there is a food and beverage service, an adjacent room can be set up for this, or it should be set up in an area of the workshop room that will cause the least amount of disturbance to the ongoing training.


    **Event Promotion**:

    *How will you promote your event ?

    *What contacts do you have in the community ?

    *What groups are active in your area that match your target audience ?


    * **Tip**:  The following is a suggested list of ways to promote your event


    * Personal Contacts

    * Email distribution lists

    * Twitter - pre-schedule tweets before and during lead-up to event

    * Meetup groups - contact the organizers to see if they will post your event

    * Local newspapers

    * Event page or website

    * Blogging about your event


    **Audio-Visual Needs**:

    * What A/V setup do you need to accommodate the sprint format ?

    * What will the venue provide ?

    * What will you have to bring ?


    * **Tip**: The following is a recommended list of equipment that should be onsite for the workshop:

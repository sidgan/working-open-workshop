                </p>
            
              <h2>Create a checklist:</h2>
              <time>2 minutes each</time>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  - Make a list of tasks that need to be completed and group based on timeframes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  - Assign an amount of time needed to complete the task.
                </li>
                <li>
                  - Order the tasks taking into consideration any dependancies, ie. tasks that can't be started before another task is finished.
                </li>
                <li>
                  - Look at any dependancies, ie. tasks that can't be started before another task is finished.
                <li>
                  - Identify points where you may need help from others such as MSL team, a design team or individuals/groups in your institution or community.
                </li>
                <li>
                  - Enter your task into your favourite calendar software adding reminders or spreadsheet software, or github as a project management issue.
                </li>
              </ul>
                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> 
                 Work backwards from key dates, looking at any dependencies that may impact completion of any task.
                </p>
              <h2>Venue and Room Set-up:</h2>
              <time>2 minutes each</time>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  - Where will the event be held ?  Take a moment to think about three possible places for your event.
                </li>
                <li>
                  - How many will it need to hold ?
                </li>
                <li>
                  - How will the room be arranged ?
                </li>
                <li>
                  - Are there lots of power options ?
                <li>
              </ul>
                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> When considering a venue make sure to pick one that is accessible, close to public transit and has parking options for those coming from a distance.  Also think about a space that allows lots of participant engagement and casual working areas so that there is lots of opportunity to encourage conversations.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> The room should be large enough to hold all attendees at round tables. For example, for a group of 60 attendees there should be room for 8-10 tables, if the tables seat 6-8 attendees. There should be space at the front of the room for a podium, a flip chart, and projection screen that is visible to all attendees.
                </p>
              <h2>Food and Beverage:</h2>
              <time>2 minutes each</time>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  - Is there a budget for food.
                </li>
                <li>
                  - What food will you provide ?
                </li>
              </ul>
                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Food and beverage service is not required, but is typically appreciated by attendees. Taking breaks over food encourages conversation and provides an opportunity for others to hear what is being worked on.  For full-day workshops, it is recommended that light breakfast items along with coffee and tea be provided in the morning, lunch at midday, and a light snack during an afternoon break. It is useful to have coffee and water provided throughout the day, if possible.
                </p>

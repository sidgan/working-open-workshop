      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        When you're starting on an open source project, it's important to record what your community (this might just be you at the beginning) decides to work on! A roadmap organizes the tasks that nees to be done on a project around milestones. This helps potential contributors understand the current status of your poject and where it's going next.
      </p>

      <p>
        A roadmap can also express your vision for the project. Make sure you clearly state why you are implementing certain things to get people excited about joining.
      </p>

      <p>
        This can be as simple as a collection of issues in your issue tracker, or a detailed timeline complete with milestones. It's up to you to choose what works best for your community! At the Mozilla Science Lab, we break our Roadmaps into three sections:
      </p>

      <section class="example">
        <section class="title">
          <h1>Roadmap Structure</h1>
        </section>
        <section class="content">
          <p>
            <strong>1. Project Mission & Summary</strong> - Welcome and orient visitors to your project. Users may have been linked directly to the Roadmap, it's important to help them understand where they are.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>2. How to Get Involved</strong> - New contributors might want to jump in right away! This points them to parts of the project they can immediately work on.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>3. Timeline</strong> - The star of the roadmap!
            This section organizes tasks needed to complete your project around milestones, mapping out what you're working on now and where it's going next.
          </p>

      </ul>

      <h2 id="steps-to-complete">Steps to Complete</h2>

      <ol class="steps">
        <!-- Step 1 -->
        <li>
          <h1>Add your "Project Mission & Summary"</h1>
          <time>5 minutes</time>
          <p>
            Use this space to orient and welcome new visitors. Start with the project name along with your mission statement or a clear summary of what you are doing. If you've already written a README, you can adapt the summary and add a shorter version here.
          </p>

          <p>
            For more information on writing a project mission statement or summary, see the <a>Writing a README Exercise</a>.
          </p>

        </li>

        <!-- Step 2 -->
        <li>
          <h1>Write "How to Get Involved"</h1>
          <time>5-10 minutes</time>
          <p>
            New contributors might want to jump in right away! This points them to parts of the project they can immediately work on.
          </p>
        </li>

        <!-- Step 3 -->
        <li>
          <h1>Pick Milestones</h1>
          <time>10 minutes</time>
          <p>
            Depending on your project, milestones can vary from development goals to events. Here are some milestones you can use:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h2>Project Status Goals</h2>
              <p>Are you working to implement your MVP (minimum viable product) or a specific feature? Your milestones can be completing a feature or a release.</p>
              <p>examples: Get your project on Collaborate, build an MVP</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h2>Dates</h2>
              <p>If you have deadlines or a set time to work on this project, use this as a milestone!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h2>Events</h2>
              <p>If you'll be sprinting or demoing your project at an event, it's helpful to know what you'll need to complete before and during the event.</p>
              <p>examples: Mozilla Science Lab Global Sprint prep work, MozFest sprint tasks</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h2>Short, Medium & Long Term</h2>
              <p>When working with volunteers, it can be difficult to set hard deadlines. When unsure, you can use short, medium and long term milestones.
                </p>
                <p><span>Short term</span> - things you are working on now<br />
                  <span>Medium term</span> - things contributors <i>can</i> start working on that is not currently being worked on<br />
                  <span>Long term</span> - you can describe where your project is going here
                </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <!-- Step 4 -->
        <li>
          <h1>List Tasks to Complete for Each Milestone</h1>
          <time>7-10 minutes per milestone</time>
          <p>
            Take time here to explain <i>why</i> you are doing this task. This will enforce your vision for the projects.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

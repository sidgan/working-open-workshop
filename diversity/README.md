Welcome to the diversity exercise readme!

Here are some brief instructions for deploying your own diversity and inclusion exercise.


### Steps

* print the documents in this folder
* cut the worksheets such that each person will get a `diversity-tips` sheet, and a `diversity-roles` role.
* cut the `diversity-exercise` so that each group of approximately 7 people (1 person per group with a different role)
* distribute the roles and the tips to each participant, ask them to "hide" their role or be discrete
* instruct participants to play their roles while answering the questions in the `diversity-exercise` within their group
* give participants about 10 minutes to complete the exercise within their group
* regroup all participants and groups to go over the roles and the questions and help draw conclusions about how the enforced roles affected group dynamics


Thanks! I hope this helps you run your own diversity exercise.
